# Computer Perception & Robotics Curriculum

This repo is to document all the projects I have used to build my knowledge of Computer Perception and Robotics.  So far most of the resources I have found regarding Computer Perception and Robotics either only cover a small portion necessary skills or are a bit outdated.  I'll try as much as possible to pick content that will be valuable for a long time, but even if it is not, a lot of these resources should have new versions in the future (like ROS for instance). 

## Curriculum Content

### 1. Learning ROS

Note:  When running Turtle Sim, you may get some libGL errors.  In my experience, they shouldn't stop you from being able to use Turtle Sim so just keep following the directions.  The best I can tell at the moment is that they are from running on a machine without NVIDIA GPUs.  If you have an NVIDIA GPU, then maybe these won't occur for you.

Turtle Sim is the ROS community intro to all the components of a ROS program.  Nothing special here, just go through the tutorial and make sure you can get it to work.

I used this version of the tutorial, but if you are working with a newer or older version of ROS it may not work for you (https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Introducing-Turtlesim/Introducing-Turtlesim.html#install-turtlesim)

### 2. Learning Visual SLAM

To learn about visual SLAM I am working through the contents of this [book](https://github.com/gaoxiang12/slambook-en).  Personally, I find it hard to focus on things that aren't clearly related to what I am interested in, so I started from the chapters I was most excited about and worked from there, going back to learn other topics when I got stuck.  An environment and code examples from this book are in the `Learning-VSLAM` folder.
